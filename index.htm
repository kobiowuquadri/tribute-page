            I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the
            iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a
            great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day
            and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to
            own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than
            before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man
            and I will never forget him.

            As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences
            from my MacBook Pro. Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture
            that cannot be rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy
            to his family and friends.

          <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
          <p>
            What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've
            written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been
            published), almost every email I've ever written, has been written
            on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple
            machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to
            realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his
            vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr.
            Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

            A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I
            felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still
            saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his
            struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angele.

            Dear Apple I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve
            Jobs, the great leader and creator in the world. I believe he would
            go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger
            Apple. We will remember him forever.

            Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to
            describe my feelings... For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job
            using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple.
            And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me
            everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be
            remembered around the world as a genius.
